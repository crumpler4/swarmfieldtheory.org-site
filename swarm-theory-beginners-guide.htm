    <h2>1. Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>Physics has long been split in two: relativity for gravity and spacetime, quantum mechanics for matter and particles. Both are correct, yet incompatible. Swarm Theory bridges the divide, starting with geometry itself — space as a woven structure. Imagine quantum foam not as chaos, but as a lattice of bubbles. From this structure, energy, light, and matter emerge naturally.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Zero Nodes and Coherence Membranes</h2>
    <p><strong>Zero Nodes</strong> are the hollow centers of bubbles — voids anchoring the lattice.  
       <strong>Coherence Membranes</strong> are the 2-D surfaces stretched between them, forming real space though they have no thickness.</p>
    <p>Together they weave a foamy geometry. Volume arises from countless intersecting flat surfaces, just as soap bubbles form structure.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. How Waves Move</h2>
    <p>Energy travels as ripples along these membranes. A photon is a helical wave bound to a surface, advancing across the weave. Like sound on a drumhead, the membrane—not the void—carries vibration.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. What Light Really Is</h2>
    <p>Light in Swarm Theory is a coherence wave traveling on membranes — not a particle, not self-luminous. It becomes visible only when detected. Light is structured tension rippling through geometry, energy stored in the lattice waiting for translation into sight.</p>
    <h3>Maxwell’s Equations</h3>
    <p>Maxwell described how electric and magnetic fields oscillate to form light. Swarm Theory keeps those equations but explains why they work: these fields express membrane tension.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Quantization — Why Energy Comes in Packets</h2>
    <p>A stretched surface vibrates in fixed modes—like drum tones. Membrane tension locks vibration into discrete steps. Planck’s constant represents that built-in scale. Energy is quantized because geometry only permits vibration in packets.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Gravity, Curvature, and Condensates</h2>
    <p>Some waves fold back and lock into repeating patterns—standing swarms of coherence. These are condensates, the origins of matter. Like stable hurricanes, they persist as self-reinforcing vortices. Electrons and protons are such stable swarms; neutrons are only stable inside atoms.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. What Matter Really Is</h2>
    <p>There is no hidden particle “stuff.” Matter is tension in the lattice — waves condensed and stabilized into swarms. The universe’s substance is light trapped by geometry into persistence.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. The Unified Field Equation Without Math</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Flat membranes under tension → quantum behaviour.</li>
      <li>Curved membranes around condensates → gravity.</li>
      <li>Both are one structure, governed by one rule.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Why This Is Radical</h2>
    <p>Swarm Theory suggests constants like <em>h</em>, <em>c</em>, and ε₀ emerge from the foam-like geometry of space. Instead of new particles or dimensions, physics reduces to a lattice of voids and surfaces under tension. Matter is condensed light; space itself is the structured medium.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>10. Why This Is Not the Aether</h2>
    <p>The classical Aether was thought to fill space like a fluid; experiments disproved it. Swarm Theory is different — space <em>is</em> the structure, a lattice of voids and surfaces. There is nothing to move through: the membranes <em>are</em> geometry itself.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>11. Where This Goes Next</h2>
    <p>This framework must be tested, refined, and challenged. It offers a unified picture: light and matter as states of the same wave-lattice. Some waves race freely; others condense into stable swarms forming matter. The universe is a foam of nothingness and surfaces under tension, alive with ripples and enduring swarms. There is no hidden particle-stuff — only light shaping itself into matter.</p>
