        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This page is the nontechnical explanation of Swarm Theory. It follows the same ideas as the technical paper
          <em>Swarm Theory: A Unified Field Framework</em> but uses plain language and imagery. It explains why space is treated as a structured lattice of membranes and voids, why light rides on those membranes, and how matter is just waves that refused to disperse.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="why-this-matters">
        <h2>1. Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>Physics has lived with a split for more than a century. Relativity works for gravity and curved spacetime. Quantum mechanics works for particles and probabilities. Both are right, but they do not meet. Swarm Theory proposes to close that gap without inventing extra particles or dimensions. It starts with geometry: space itself is woven.</p>
        <p>Think of the quantum foam not as randomness, but as organised bubbles. From that organised lattice, the rules of light, matter, and gravity follow.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="zero-nodes">
        <h2>2. Zero Nodes and Coherence Membranes</h2>
        <p><strong>Zero Nodes</strong> are absolute voids. Nothing is inside them, not even space. They are like the hollow centres of bubbles. They anchor the structure.</p>
        <p><strong>Coherence Membranes</strong> are the two-dimensional skins stretched between Zero Nodes. They have no thickness but they are real. They are what we experience as space.</p>
        <p>When many such membranes intersect, they form the foamy volume of the universe — just like real soap bubbles form a 3D shape out of 2D skins.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="waves">
        <h2>3. How Waves Move</h2>
        <p>Energy does not travel through empty nothing. It travels along these membranes as ripples. A photon is not a marble flying through emptiness; it is a helical wave bound to a path on the lattice, progressing step by step.</p>
        <p>This is like sound on a drumhead: the drum’s cavity is empty, but the skin carries the vibration. In Swarm Theory, membrane tension carries light.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="light">
        <h2>4. What Light Really Is</h2>
        <p>Light is a coherence wave on the membranes. It is not “bright” while it travels. It becomes light only when it is detected. Until then it is structured tension, neatly moving across a geometric surface.</p>
        <h3>4a. Maxwell’s Equations</h3>
        <p>Maxwell already told us light is an electromagnetic wave at a fixed speed. Swarm Theory does not change Maxwell. It explains what Maxwell’s fields are made of: they are how membrane tension looks to us when we measure it.</p>
        <p><strong>Maxwell says:</strong> “this is how light behaves.”  
           <strong>Swarm Theory adds:</strong> “it behaves that way because it is a wave on a tensioned lattice.”</p>
      </section>

      <section id="quantisation">
        <h2>5. Quantisation — Why Energy Comes in Packets</h2>
        <p>A stretched surface cannot vibrate at any frequency it wants. It picks certain modes. A drum does this. So does a violin string.</p>
        <p>Membrane tension in Swarm Theory does the same thing. It permits only discrete vibrations. That is why Planck’s constant exists. Quanta are not an arbitrary rule — they are what a tensioned geometric surface allows.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="gravity">
        <h2>6. Gravity, Curvature, and Condensates</h2>
        <p>Most waves spread and fade. Some do not. Under the right conditions, waves fold back on themselves and reinforce. That produces a persistent pattern — a <strong>condensate</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is like weather: most gusts die, but occasionally the energy, rotation, and environment line up and you get a stable hurricane.</p>
        <p>In Swarm Theory, those stable “hurricanes” of coherence are what we call particles. Electrons and protons are the ones the lattice supports indefinitely. Neutrons, by contrast, need extra structure (for example, a nucleus) to stay around.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="matter">
        <h2>7. What Matter Really Is</h2>
        <p>There is no hidden “particle stuff” underneath. Everything is lattice tension.</p>
        <p>Matter is just light and other lattice waves that have condensed and locked in. Radiation and matter are made of the same thing; the difference is whether they disperse or persist.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="ufe">
        <h2>8. The Unified Field Equation Without Math</h2>
        <p>The technical paper shows the full equation. In words, it says:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Flat, tensioned membranes → quantum behaviour.</li>
          <li>Curved membranes around persistent swarms → gravity.</li>
          <li>Both are the same underlying structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So you do not need two incompatible theories; you need one geometric one.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="not-aether">
        <h2>9. Why This Is Not the Aether</h2>
        <p>Classical aether was a fluid filling space. It was ruled out because we could not detect motion through it and relativity did not need it.</p>
        <p>Swarm Theory does not bring that back. It says space <em>is</em> the structure — the membranes themselves. There is nothing to move through, because the geometry is the medium.</p>
        <p>In the old view, matter floated in a medium. In Swarm Theory, matter is simply persistent waves of the medium itself.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="next">
        <h2>10. Where This Goes Next</h2>
        <p>This framework has to be tested. But it gives you a very compact picture:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Space is a foam of voids and 2D surfaces under tension.</li>
          <li>Light is membrane tension in motion.</li>
          <li>Matter is light that got trapped into a stable swirl.</li>
          <li>Gravity is curvature of those tensioned surfaces.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Nothing magic. Just geometry with tension.</p>
