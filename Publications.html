  <p class="tag"><em>The Raychaudhuri Equation in Coherence Form: A Swarm Theory Interpretation</em></p>
  <p>
    This paper presents a Lagrangian derivation of the Raychaudhuri equation within the framework of Swarm Field Theory (SFT). Spacetime curvature, expansion, and collapse are reinterpreted as mechanical effects of tension and strain in a discrete coherence lattice. The analysis unifies the geometric and mechanical descriptions of spacetime and provides a foundation for the Unified Field Equation (UFE).

  <p class="tag"><em>A Two-Dimensional Curvature Model Explains Flat Galactic Rotation Curves Without Dark Matter: A Swarm Theory Interpretation</em></p>
  <p>Galactic rotation curves remain approximately flat at large radii, a phenomenon commonly attributed to invisible “dark matter” halos. Within Swarm Theory, physical space is a tensioned coherence lattice—an interconnected network of 2-D membranes bearing surface tension ΔI [J m⁻²]. Matter acts as persistent curvature within this lattice, and gravitation emerges from gradients of lattice tension rather than unseen mass. This paper derives the rotation velocity v(r) from first principles, showing that a logarithmic tension profile ΔI(r)∝ln r naturally yields flat rotation curves and reproduces the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation v_flat⁴∝B. No auxiliary matter fields are required.

  <p class="tag"><em>Swarm Field Theory Calculator of Quantum Mechanics</em></p>
  <p>
    The Swarm Field Equations Calculator is a transparent, working tool that derives physical constants from the lattice geometry of Swarm Field Theory. It allows direct comparison between theoretical predictions and CODATA values, with a toggleable correction factor to show uncorrected versus corrected results. This is not just another paper — it is a calculator you can inspect, test, and challenge. Disruptive by design, it demonstrates how close a new framework can come to reproducing the constants of nature from first principles.

  <p class="tag"><em>Compactification of Quantum Mechanics: Two Postulates, One Mic Drop</em></p>
  <p>
    Physics has long been burdened with dozens of constants, treated as mysterious inputs rather than natural consequences. 
    This paper shows that everything collapses to just <strong>two postulates</strong>. From them, all else follows — 
    Planck’s constant, the speed of light, the fine-structure constant, electric charge, permittivity, permeability, 
    Boltzmann’s constant… even gravity.
