    <h2>The Lattice</h2>
    <p>
      In Swarm Theory, the fundamental structure of reality is not empty space but a lattice of <em>zero nodes</em> 
      surrounded by flat, tension-bearing membranes. These membranes intersect like woven planes, enclosing each node 
      as if within a geodesic sphere. The lattice is a tension-weave: real, massless, and continuous.
    </p>

    <div class="axiom">
      <strong>Axiom — Real Space:</strong> <em>Real space is anything on the membrane.</em>
    </div>

    <p>
      Distances, directions, fields, waves, and matter exist only on the membranes. They do not float in a background void. 
      Where the membrane goes, space goes. Where the membrane does not exist, neither does space.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the Interiors Are Not Real Space</h2>
    <p>
      Each node’s membranes enclose an interior volume, but this interior is not part of the universe. 
      It is not “empty space” — it is the absence of space. Inside, there are no distances to measure, 
      no directions to point, no fields to propagate. This is why waves cannot enter zero nodes: 
      there is nowhere for them to go. Reality is confined to the membrane itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Waves Travel Helically</h2>
    <p>
      A wave bound to two-dimensional membranes cannot move in a straight line through three-dimensional geometry. 
      To advance, it must wrap around the lattice planes, tracing a helix. The helical path is longer than the straight-line 
      projection. This explains why the observed speed of light <code>c</code> is a projected value of the maximum lattice speed 
      <code>c<sub>max</sub></code>, with Arthur’s Constant κ capturing the ratio.
    </p>
    <p>
      The helix is not optional. It is the only way a coherence wave can remain bound to the membrane structure while moving forward.
    </p>

    <h2>Consequences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Membranes define where space exists. Interiors are not “places.”</li>
      <li><strong>Quantization:</strong> Helical propagation leads directly to discrete action values, including Planck’s constant.</li>
      <li><strong>Forces as geometry:</strong> Gravity, inertia, and electromagnetism emerge from membrane tension and curvature.</li>
      <li><strong>Projection effects:</strong> The observed constants of physics arise from the geometry of helical propagation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Light and Vision: Common Questions</h2>

<h3>Do we really see in straight lines?</h3>
<p>
No. We only register the lattice waves that strike the retina. 
Your brain reconstructs the scene as if lines extend outward, but vision is not a probe into the world. 
It is the end-point of a wave that has already traveled through the lattice.
</p>

<h3>If light travels helically, why does it look straight?</h3>
<p>
The helical motion is projected onto our three-dimensional experience. 
What you perceive as a straight beam is the projection of a longer, spiral path wrapped around the membranes. 
This projection is why the observed speed of light is lower than the lattice’s maximum propagation speed.
</p>

<h3>Why does light seem instantaneous?</h3>
<p>
Light moves very fast compared to everyday timescales, but never infinitely fast. 
What seems immediate is actually the finite arrival of a helical wave across the lattice. 
The time it takes is real — measurable in nanoseconds and years, depending on the distance.
</p>

<h3>Can we see inside a zero node?</h3>
<p>
No. The interior of a zero node is not part of real space. 
There is no distance, no field, no geometry to support waves or vision. 
Everything we see is bound to the membranes; the “insides” of nodes are permanently excluded from perception.
</p>

<h3>So what do we really see?</h3>
<p>
We see lattice events. 
Light is a wave bound to the membrane network, and vision is simply the registration of those waves at the eye. 
Our perception is a reconstruction of what the lattice allowed to propagate — nothing more, nothing less.

</p>
<h3>Why We Cannot See the Lattice</h3>
<p>
The lattice itself is not visible. It is the stage on which all physical events occur, but it does not cast shadows or reflect images back to us. 
You cannot look at space and see the weave of membranes. 
What you see is only the photon that reaches your retina — a single lattice event resolving on a biological detector.
</p>

<p>
Think of the lattice as a <strong>projector</strong> and your retina as a <strong>screen</strong>. 
The helical waves that propagate across the membranes carry the information, but you never see the projector itself. 
You only perceive the final frame — the photon strike that triggers a signal in the eye.
</p>

<p>
This is why the weave of real space remains hidden: the 3D geometry supports the propagation of light, but it is not light. 
Your vision is a reconstruction built from the lattice’s outputs, not a direct picture of the lattice itself.
</p>
<h2>Is this the Holographic Principle proposed by ’t Hooft, Susskind, and others?</h2>
<p>
Not exactly. The holographic principle in mainstream physics arose from black hole thermodynamics. 
It states that the information in a 3D region can be fully described by data on its 2D boundary. 
In AdS/CFT, for example, a gravitational theory in the bulk corresponds to a quantum field theory on the boundary.
</p>

<p>
Swarm Theory is different. Here, the <em>membranes themselves are space</em>. 
The interiors of the bubbles are not space at all. 
Our perception of light is not a direct view of the lattice, but the result of a photon resolving on the retina. 
This creates a projector-and-screen relationship that feels holographic in flavor, but is built from geometry and coherence rather than information bounds.
</p>

<p>
So while the two ideas both emphasize the role of 2D structures in defining 3D reality, they are not the same. 
The holographic principle is about information and entropy. 
Swarm Theory is about the geometric substrate of space itself.
</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Real space is the membrane. Waves and matter live only on the lattice weave. 
      The interiors of node enclosures are excluded from reality, not voids but the absence of geometry. 
      Helical propagation is demanded by this structure, and from it arise the constants and quantization of physics.
